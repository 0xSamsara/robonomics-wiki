  "Robonomics Smart Home Overview",
  "Secure IoT with Blockchain",
  "For your smart home, the modern IoT market provides a wide range of solutions. But you are usually tied to centralized cloud providers or expensive proprietary gateways. As a result, you as a user are always dependent on the hardware and infrastructure vendor to run your smart system. At the same time, your smart home cannot be truly smart without cloud statistics and analytics.",
  "**We see two main problems with current smart homes:**",
  "1. You have no control over what data you share with the vendor or third party.",
  "2. Your smart home is vulnerable to shutdowns of centralized cloud servers.",
  "To solve both problems, we suggest you to try Robonomics, our **secure**, **serverless** and **futuristic** decentralized cloud.",
  "Steps to corporate-free cloud",
  "Here are some simple steps to create an affordable smart home using Home Assistant as a device communication application and Robonomics as a corporate-free, decentralized cloud platform. Robonomics leverages modern and secure Web3 technologies, ensuring enhanced security throughout the process.",
  "Start here your smart home",
  "We have prepared detailed guides on setting up a smart home on Robonomics. The steps may vary depending on your specific situation: whether you already have an operational Home Assistant with paired devices, or if you are starting from scratch to establish your smart home.",
  "Robonomics Video Service",
  "This article shows how to add an IP camera to Home Assistant and send videos to Robonomics Web Service.",
  "To connect a camera to Home Assistant, you need to know its IP address and create a local camera account to connect to the RTSP stream.",
  "Since this is done differently for each camera, this process is not considered in this article.",
  "Requirements:",
  "IP camera",
  "Configured local camera account",
  "IP address of the camera",
  "Configured Home Assistant",
  "This article assumes that you have a general IP camera without RTZ (rotate, tilt, zoom) options.",
  "If you have an RTZ camera, check [\"RTZ camera\" article](/docs/ptz-camera). And then come back to a second step here.",
  "Connect the Camera",
  "To do so, try entering the following query on the Internet: \"<CAMERA_NAME> RTSP stream\".",
  "Stream URL must start with `rtsp://<IP_Address>...`.",
  "This article uses a \"Tapo\" camera and the stream path is `rtsp://<IP_Address>/stream1`.",
  "Open Home Assistant and go to \"Settings\"-> \"Devices & Services\". Press the \"ADD INTEGRATION\" button and",
  "start typing \"Generic Camera\" integration. Choose it.",
  "In the configuration window provide the following information:",
  "The URL of camera's RTSP stream",
  "write a username of your local camera account",
  "write a password for your local camera account",
  "Scroll down the settings and press the \"Submit\" button.",
  "In Preview window activate the checkbox \"This image looks good.\" and press the \"Submit\" button. Then - \"Finish\".",
  "Add to the Dashboard",
  "Additionally, you can add the stream to your dashboard. To do this, navigate to the dashboard and create a new card",
  "\"Picture Glance\". Further steps:",
  "enter the \"Title\" you want",
  "delete data from \"Image Path\"",
  "select the camera in \"Camera Entity\"",
  "in the \"Camera View\", select \"live\" so that there is less delay",
  "And save it.",
  "Check media folder",
  "Before being sent to the Robonomics Video Service, the video must be saved in a folder, and Home Assistant must have access to this folder.",
  "The easiest option in this case is to use a media pack, in which the Home Assistant stores all the media.",
  "If you use HAOS or Pre-installed Image your Home Assistant **already has Media folder**.",
  "If you use Home Assistant Core, you should go to `.homeassistant` folder and create `media` folder in it.",
  "If you use Home Assistant Docker, add ` -v /PATH_TO_YOUR_MEDIA:/media \\` line to the Docker command.",
  "To check that everything was set up correctly, go to the “Media” -> “local media” tab in your Home Assistant.",
  "You should see an empty folder (no errors):",
  "Service Call",
  "To send a video to Robonomics, you should call a dedicated service in Home Assistant.",
  "In this article this is done manually, but you can create an automation for it.",
  "To do this, go to \"Developer tools\" -> \"Services\" and find \"Robonomics: Save recording to Robonomics\".",
  "In \"Targets\" choose your camera entity.",
  "In \"Path to save the recording\" you should provide an absolute path to the folder,",
  "where Home Assistant can save the video:",
  "For Pre-installed image",
  "For HA OS or Home Assistant Docker",
  "For Home Assistant Core - Path to previously created media folder.",
  "Additionally, you can choose the recording Duration.",
  "Fill in the data and call the service with the \"CALL SERVICE\" button.",
  "To view the resulted video go to [Robonomics DAPP](https://vol4tim.github.io/videostream/).",
  "Paste in your controller's account address and click the button below. Wait for the \"Search for Twins\" process.",
  "As a result, you will get an IPFS CID with all recorded videos.",
  "Next, select the controller account (or any other) from the drop-down list and sign a message for authorization in",
  "the Web3 IPFS gateway to download all the videos. As a result, you will obtain all the videos recorded by your smart home.",
  "Since all the videos in the folder are encrypted with the controller key, you need to insert it to decrypt videos.",
  "After that, the video playback button is activated. Click on it to download the video.",
  "How to Run Robonomics Dev Node",
  "**For testing your applications on Robonomics you may want to run it in the dev mode. This article shows step-by-step",
  "instructions how to get your own local testing instance of Robonomics.**",
  "Get Node Binary",
  "1. First, you need a binary file, download the archive with it from the latest [release](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics/releases).",
  "2. Navigate to the archive folder, unpack the binary and change permissions:",
  "Run",
  "Run the node with:",
  "You will see the following output:",
  "If you want to purge existing blocks you may do this with removing RocksDB at `/tmp/substrate******/chains/dev/db/full`.",
  "Replace `******` with a corresponding identifier displayed in logs on launch.",
  "If you want to start the node from scratch every time use `--tmp` flag.",
  "Connect",
  "Now you can connect to your local node through the [Polkadot Portal](https://polkadot.js.org/apps/#/explorer).",
  "Change the network to `Local Node` in the upper left corner and press `Switch`.",
  "Welcome to the local instance of Robonomics!"
