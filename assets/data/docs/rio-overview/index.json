Sets a custom logging filter. Syntax is <target>=<level>, e.g. -lsync=debug\n\nSUBCOMMANDS:\n    help     Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)\n    read     Read information from device\n    write    Write information into device\n```\n\n## The Pipeline Philosophy \n\nThe tool is designed in order to be included in a pipeline chain of processes. From Unix user experience everyone is familiar with commands like:\n\n```\nps aux | grep robonomics\n```\n\nIt means standard output produced by the `ps` program becomes standard input for the `grep` program. \n\nThe `robonomics io` consists of several subcommands with reading, writing abilities or both. It treats everything as a virtual or physical device ([everything is a file](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Everything_is_a_file))\n\n## Read Overview\n\nIn general `read` means it reads data from a device or a network and prints it in `stdout`.\n\nHow to use it for:\n\n* [ipfs](/docs/rio-ipfs)\n* [launch](/docs/rio-launch)\n* [pubsub](/docs/rio-pubsub)\n* [sds011](/docs/rio-sds011)\n\n```\n% ./robonomics io read\nrobonomics-io-read 0.4.0\nRead information from device\n\nUSAGE:\n    robonomics io read <SUBCOMMAND>\n\nFLAGS:\n    -h, --help       Prints help information\n    -V, --version    Prints version information\n\nSUBCOMMANDS:\n    help      Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)\n    ipfs      Download data from IPFS storage\n    launch    Robot launch request events\n    pubsub    Subscribe for broadcasing data\n    sds011    Nova SDS011 particle sensor\n```\n\n## Write Overview\n\nUsually it writes data to blockchain or publishes to pubsub channel. \n\nHow to use it for:\n\n* [datalog](/docs/rio-datalog)\n* [ipfs](/docs/rio-ipfs)\n* [launch](/docs/rio-launch)\n* [pubsub](/docs/rio-pubsub)\n\n```\n% ./robonomics io write\nrobonomics-io-write 0.4.0\nWrite information into device\n\nUSAGE:\n    robonomics io write <SUBCOMMAND>\n\nFLAGS:\n    -h, --help       Prints help information\n    -V, --version    Prints version information\n\nSUBCOMMANDS:\n    datalog    Data blockchainization subsystem command\n    help       Prints this message or the help of the given subcommand(s)\n    ipfs       Upload data into IPFS storage\n    launch     CPS launch subsystem command\n    pubsub     Broadcast data into PubSub topic\n```\n\n"}},"context":{}}
