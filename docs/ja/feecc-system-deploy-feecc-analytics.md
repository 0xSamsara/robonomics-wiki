In this guide, we will talk about the deployment of Feecc Analytics.

You will need `git` and `docker-compose` (v3 or higher) installed in order to run

## Analytics backend startup

### Clone source code

Run:

```
git clone https://github.com/Multi-Agent-io/feecc-analytics-backend
```

To access dev version (beta) change branch to `development`

### Configuration

Edit your `.env` file with any text editor.

`.env` options:

* `MONGO_CONNECTION_URL` - URL MongoDB (in form of `mongodb://<username:password>@<host>:<port>/<defaultauthdb>`)

* `MONGO_DATABASE_NAME` - name of mongodb database which will be used for reading/writing data

* `SECRET_KEY` - secret key for hash/dehash

* `IPFS_GATEWAY_HOST` - URL of IPFS Gateway

* `USE_DATALOG` - Will analytics send data to Robonomics Datalog (True/False)

* `ROBONOMICS_SEED` - Seed-phrase of the Robonomics wallet on the **Kusama** network

### Application startup

Run `docker-compose up --build` to start an application

If some parameters were not filled (or filled incorrectly) the system will generate an error, in this case check the correctness of filling the `.env`

### Check deployment

To check startup, go to `localhost:5002/docs`. 

If all done correctly, you will see a page (generated by Swagger) with all Feecc Analytics REST API endpoints. Now you are ready to launch the frontend.
