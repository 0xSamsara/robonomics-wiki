# Getting Started
Robonomics platform provides tools for working with the robot economy network. Robonomics allow designers of smart cities and industry 4.0 zones to build trust among the [autonomous robots services](glossary.md#cyber-physical-system), provide [direct user access via dapp](glossary.md#dapp) for ordering products from autonomous factories and services of urban sensor networks. This in turn will allow us to put in place a decentralized system that globally monitors the activities of cyber physical systems.

The following chart describes what place Robonomics takes in the scenario.

## What the documentation contains

### Get Weather on Fuji Mountain Demo
Easy way to try Robonomics yourself [here](try_it_out/get_weather_on_fuji_mountain.md)!

### I'm interested in using Robonomics services

Take a look at the [Robonomics Dapp](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/). Get familiar with the statistic, average miner reward etc.
Try out existing [services](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/services)

### I'm a Dapp developer

There are [Robonomics-js](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-js) library and [dapp template](https://github.com/airalab/vue-dapp-robonomics-template)

The documentation is in [Learn](robonomics-js.md) section

### I'm a robotics engineer

Check out [cases](cases/open_sensor_network_run_by_ipfs.md) section and start developing by [examples](agent_development/examples.md)
