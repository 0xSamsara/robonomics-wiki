## What the documentation contains

### Get Weather on Fuji Mountain Demo
Try Robonomics yourself [here](try_it_out/get_weather_on_fuji_mountain.md)!

### I'm interested in using Robonomics services

Take a look at the [Robonomics Dapp](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/). Get familiar with the statistic, average miner reward etc.
Try out existing [services](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/services)

### I'm a Dapp developer

There are [Robonomics-js](https://github.com/airalab/robonomics-js) library and [dapp template](https://github.com/airalab/vue-dapp-robonomics-template)

The documentation is in [Learn](robonomics-js.md) section

### I'm a robotics engineer

Check out [cases](cases/open_sensor_network_run_by_ipfs.md) section and start developing by [examples](agent_development/examples.md)
