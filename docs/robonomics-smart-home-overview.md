The modern IoT market provides the user a large selection of smart home solutions, but they are all tied to centralized cloud providers or expensive proprietary gateways.
As a result, you as a user are always dependent on the hardware and infrastructure vendor to run the entire system.

**We see two main problems with current smart homes:**

1. You have no control over what data you share with the vendor or third party.
2. You have a single point of failure in the form of centralized vendor cloud servers.

To solve both problems, we suggest you to try Robonomics, our **secure**, **serverless** and **futuristic** decentralized cloud.
