# Get Open Data from Sensor 

Let's start from a quick example of what Robonomics is able to do within 5 minutes.

> Requirements: [Metamask extension](https://metamask.io/)

Open <a href="https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/sensors/airalab/QmbQT8cj9TJKfYVaidfShnrEX1g14yTC9bdG1XbcRX73wY/0x4D8a26e1f055c0b28D71cf1deA05f0f595a6975d/" target="_blank">sensor demo</a> website and follow instructions below

### 1. Open the Dapp

You see the next picture in case you don't have MetaMask extension. Go to the link provided above and install one
!["No MetaMask"](../img/try_it_out/sensor_demo/sensor-demo-1.png "No MetaMask")

### 2. Allow connection to the extension

### 3. Press "Request current values"
!["Order"](../img/try_it_out/sensor_demo/sensor-demo-3.png "Order")

### 4. Sign a message. No token or ether are needed

### 5. Wait until the agent collects the data and sends it back
!["Wait for the agent"](../img/try_it_out/sensor_demo/sensor-demo-5.png "Wait for the agent")

### 6. Wait until the Dapp downloads the result file from IPFS
!["Wait for IPFS"](../img/try_it_out/sensor_demo/sensor-demo-6.png "Wait for IPFS")

### 7. Look at the data
!["Data"](../img/try_it_out/sensor_demo/sensor-demo-7.png "Data")

Just now you have broadcasted a demand message and got a result from an autonomous agent! The result file is stored in IPFS, the result message is signed with the agent's private key.
