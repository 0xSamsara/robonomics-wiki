# Create Digital Identity Run by Ethereum

One of the Robonomics services is [Digital Passport Registration](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/passport/) for arbitrary data.

The service allows you to create a digital identity saving the hashes of the data to the public blockchain and assigning a unique address.

You can find the service [here](https://dapp.robonomics.network/#/passport/) or via the main [Dapp](https://dapp.robonomics.network/) -> Services -> Digital Passport Registration.

The following video shows a progress of Robonomics Whitepaper registration:
