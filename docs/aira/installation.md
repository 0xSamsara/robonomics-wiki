![Under Construction](../img/under_construction.png "Under Construction")

In the other [article](../try_it_out/aira_installation.md) it was shown how to launch AIRA in VirtualBox. 

The installation on Raspberry Pi is as simple as writing an image of AIRA on SD card using `dd` or [Etcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/), for example.

This article includes two tutorials:

1. Installation communication stack on your laptop for development purpose
2. Switching a bare NixOS to AIRA
